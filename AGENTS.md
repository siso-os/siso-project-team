# AGENTS.md — the front door

**In one line:** Project-team-in-a-box: the roles, contracts, task spine, shared browser and tooling that give a new SISO project a working agent team. District: `SISO_Agents` (`~/SISO_Workspace/SISO_Agents/siso-project-team`).

You are joining a SISO project team. Read this, then the one skill for your role. Nothing else
is required to act.

## Find out who you are

| If you were started… | You are | Read next |
|---|---|---|
| in the team space's first pane, cwd `/opt/siso-agent-zero` (or the project's equivalent), with no brief | the **project Agent Zero** | `skills/project-agent-zero/SKILL.md` |
| in a pane with a `TASK-*.md` brief naming a domain | an **owner** | `skills/owner/SKILL.md` |
| by herdr or an owner with a `JOB-*.md` naming files, a command and an expected result | an **arm** (worker) | `skills/worker-contract/SKILL.md` |

Above every team sits Shaan's **personal Agent Zero** (`siso-agent-zero-protocol`). It reads
`teams/<slug>/DIGEST.md`; it is not a second orchestrator, and owners never address it.
Harnesses, as ruled 2026-09-11: Opus roles run on Claude Code; Qwen and Luna arms run on Codex,
spawned with `tools/spawn-worker`, and message back when done.

`team.yaml` in this repo — or `teams/<project>/team.yaml` — tells you the host, the herdr
space, the Plane project, the deploy script, the docs URL and where the intent log is.

## The five rules, whoever you are

1. **Talk up, not out.** Owners and arms message the project Agent Zero with `tools/az-send`.
   Only the project Agent Zero speaks to the human, and only for credentials, money, or
   production data. If you find yourself writing to Shaan, stop; you have the wrong address.
2. **Prove before claiming.** Visual/UI work means a `siso-browse` screenshot exists and was
   compared beside its reference. Other work means its stated artifact, behavior, test, receipt,
   status, metric, or command acceptance was observed. A generic status code or file count is not
   proof by itself.
3. **Move pointers only through the deploy script.** Never `ln`, never `mv -T`, never a hand
   rollback. A bad release is reported to the project Agent Zero, who rolls back through the
   script.
4. **Do not rediscover.** Before you probe a machine, read a log, or write a browser script,
   check `team.yaml`, the project skill, and `tools/`. If the answer is not there and cost you
   an hour, put it in the skill — not in a chat message.
5. **Exit on handoff.** Owners and arms are disposable. Write `HANDOFF-<you>.md`, tell the
   project Agent Zero, and end your session. Resident context belongs to one agent per team.

6. **One ledger per kind, in the companion.** Decisions and traps → `DECISION-LOG.html`;
   proven claims with their receipt → `PROVEN-LEDGER.html`; who owns what → `OWNERS.md`
   under 40 lines, rows *replaced* not appended. No per-unit receipts, ACK files or evidence
   folders; read the spine, not the corpus. Oracle grew 3,000+ dated files this way and its
   agents stopped reading any of them (`docs/lessons-from-oracle.html`).

## Sending a message (the only way)

```sh
tools/az-send <pane-id> "message"
```

It clears the line, types, submits, and **reads the pane back for a spinner**. It exits
non-zero if the text is still sitting at the prompt. Ten dispatches were lost in one day to
raw `send-text` without `Enter` and to `Enter` on a stale line; do not use the raw commands.

## Browser checks (the only way)

```sh
tools/siso-browse shot  /siso-crm/health  out.png     # logged in, real session, screenshot
tools/siso-browse text  /siso-crm/tokens                # rendered text
tools/siso-browse click /siso-crm/sheets 'text=Save'    # drive it
```

One persisted login for the whole team. Never launch your own Chromium; never read the
credential file yourself; never lift the human's cookie.

## What the human already said

`teams/<project>/intent/` holds every prompt the human typed on this project, verbatim — one
file per message, `index.html` newest first, `shaan-intent-log.json` flat — written by
`tools/intent-capture`. Before you decide what "done" means, read the entries for your
domain. An audit that finds a gap between his words and the fleet's work is the most valuable
thing a fresh agent can produce here.

## Where things are, generically

- Tasks: the Plane project in `team.yaml` (`siso-plane-ops` skill; on the host use the loopback base URL).
- Machines and fleet: the herdr space in `team.yaml`; the Agents rail on the project's site.
- Deploys: the project's deploy script only; its name is in `team.yaml`.
- Docs the human reads: the docs URL in `team.yaml`. Anything he must see goes there, with a picture.
- Fleet economics (budgets, model routing, telemetry): `sisodias/siso-agent-playbook`.
- Harness changes (hooks, settings, routing): file them in `sisodias/siso-harness-lab`; do not change a team's harness ad hoc.
